    <p>This significant ruling came to light when the Court rejected a plea put forth by Tamil Nadu Minister Senthil Balaji, who had contested his detention by the ED in a money laundering case.</p>

    <p>Section 167 of the CrPC stipulates that an individual arrested by the police must be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours of the arrest. Subsequently, the magistrate can grant authorization for the person to remain in custody, be it with the police or other investigative agencies, for up to 15 days or an extended duration in cases of complex investigations.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court elucidated that the term "custody" as per Section 167 extends beyond the confines of police custody. It encompasses custody by other investigative agencies, such as the ED, provided that the magistrate is convinced of the agency's legitimate grounds for detaining the individual.</p>

    <p>The Court underscored that Section 167 serves the dual purpose of safeguarding the liberty of the accused while ensuring a fair and efficient investigation. Therefore, the magistrate's decision to authorize an accused person's detention must strike a delicate balance between these two paramount interests.</p>

    <p>In the case of Senthil Balaji, the Supreme Court determined that the ED had valid grounds for his custody. Furthermore, it found that the magistrate had meticulously considered the relevant factors before granting authorization for detention.</p>

    <p>This ruling by the Supreme Court represents a significant triumph for the ED and other investigative agencies. It unequivocally states that these agencies have the prerogative to seek custody of an accused person from a magistrate, even if the initial arrest was not made by the police. This clarification fortifies the ability of these agencies to proficiently investigate intricate financial crimes.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, the ruling serves as a poignant reminder to magistrates that they must diligently evaluate the pertinent factors before authorizing the detention of an accused person. Their role is to harmonize the protection of the accused's liberty with the imperative of conducting a just and efficient investigation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>

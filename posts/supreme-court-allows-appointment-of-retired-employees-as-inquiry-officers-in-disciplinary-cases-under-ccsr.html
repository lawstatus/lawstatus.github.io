Importantly, the Court clarified that it is not a prerequisite for the inquiry officer to be a public servant.</p>

    <p>The case before the Court stemmed from an appeal against an Odisha High Court judgment, which had relied on a previous Supreme Court case, Ravi Malik v. National Film Development Corporation. The Odisha High Court had held that a retired public servant could not be appointed as an inquiry officer based on the NFDC case.</p>

    <p>However, the Supreme Court made a crucial distinction between the two cases. It pointed out that the NFDC case applied Rule 23(b) of the NFDC Service Regulations, 1982, which explicitly stated that the disciplinary authority may appoint a "public servant" to inquire into employee misconduct. In contrast, the CCSR operates under Rule 14, which empowers the disciplinary authority to appoint an "authority" to conduct inquiries into government employee misconduct.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court held that the CCSR does not mandate the inquiry officer to be a public servant. It noted that the term "authority" in Rule 14 lacks a specific definition, allowing for a broader interpretation that could indeed include a retired employee. The Court also emphasized that the CCSR permits the disciplinary authority to delegate its powers to another individual, including the authority to appoint an inquiry officer.</p>

    <p>Therefore, the Supreme Court upheld the appeal and set aside the Odisha High Court judgment. It affirmed that the disciplinary authority had the discretion to appoint a retired employee as an inquiry officer.</p>

    <p>This landmark ruling has significant implications. It empowers the government to utilize retired employees as inquiry officers in disciplinary cases, ensuring expeditious proceedings. Retired employees, benefiting from this decision, gain new opportunities to serve as inquiry officers, leveraging their experience and expertise to ensure fairness in disciplinary proceedings.</p>

    <p>The Court's verdict strikes a balance between administrative efficiency and justice, setting a noteworthy precedent in the realm of inquiry officers' appointments.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>

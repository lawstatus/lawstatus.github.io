				<p>
					In a significant ruling, a Division Bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justices Abhay S. Oka and Sanjay
					Karol,
					made a pivotal determination during a recent hearing of appeals. The core of their judgment centers on the
					principle
					that an "assessee cannot be subjected to a penalty on the basis of a show cause notice containing a completely
					erroneous category of service."
				</p>

				<p>
					As a consequence of this ruling, the Court declared the demand made based on the aforementioned show cause
					notice
					to
					be illegal. The appeals in question stemmed from service tax demands rooted in four Show Cause Notices, all
					issued
					under Section 73 of the Finance Act, 1994. These notices pertained to the demand of service tax and are
					detailed
					as
					follows:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Show-cause notice dated: 19/10/2009 (Issued for the period of 1.4.2004 to 31.3.2009)</li>
					<li>Show-cause notice dated: 20/10/2010 (Issued for the period of 1.4.2009 to 31.3.2010)</li>
					<li>Show-cause notice dated: 21/10/2011 (Issued for the period of 1.4.2010 to 31.3.2011)</li>
					<li>Show-cause notice dated: 22/10/2012 (Issued for the period of 1.4.2011 to 31.3.2012)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					To provide context, the impugned judgment, dated 18th September 2018, by the Customs, Excise and Service Tax
					Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT) held that the services in dispute fell into the category of "Information
					Technology
					Software" starting from 16th May 2008. Prior to that date, the same services were classified as "Intellectual
					Property Service." Importantly, the Tribunal also found the show-cause notice dated 19th October 2019, which
					covered
					the period up to 16th May 2008, to be unjustified.
				</p>

				<p>
					Subsequently, the Court addressed the appeal filed by the revenue, which was limited to the first show cause
					notice.
					This notice pertained to taxable service under the label of "Management, Maintenance, and Repair." The Court
					noted
					that the demand was associated with services provided by the assessee regarding third-party software, in-house
					developed software, or customized software. These services involved the temporary transfer of the right to use
					said
					software to clients. Consequently, the correct categorization prior to 16th May 2008 was "Intellectual
					Property
					Service," and from 16th May 2008 onwards, it was "Information Technology Software."
				</p>

				<p>
					In light of these observations, the Court deemed the classification in the first show cause notice as entirely
					erroneous and refrained from intervening in the CESTAT's findings. It stressed that "elementary principles of
					natural justice required that the adjudication on the basis of show-cause notice should be made only on the
					basis
					of
					classification stated in the show cause notice. Assessee cannot be subjected to a penalty on the basis of a
					show
					cause notice containing a completely erroneous category of service."
				</p>

				<p>
					Moving forward, the Court proceeded to address the appeal filed by the assessee. In this phase, the Court
					thoroughly
					examined the validity of the other three show cause notices. Upon close scrutiny, it found that the other
					three
					notices correctly identified the classification, and their conclusions were meticulously based on a
					comprehensive
					analysis of both factual and legal aspects. Consequently, the Court declined to interfere and dismissed the
					appeal.

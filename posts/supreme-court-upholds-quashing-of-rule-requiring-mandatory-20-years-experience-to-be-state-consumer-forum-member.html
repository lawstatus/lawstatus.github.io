    <p>The case was presented before the apex court by a tenacious lawyer who undertook the noble endeavor of challenging the rule on the grounds of its perceived unfairness and inherent discrimination. The crux of the argument rested on the assertion that this rule unjustly excluded a multitude of qualified individuals from participating in the operations of the SCDRC, solely on the basis of their inability to demonstrate two decades of professional experience.</p>

    <p>The Supreme Court, donning the mantle of judicial activism, deemed it appropriate to lend its endorsement to the lawyer's legal contentions, echoing the sentiment that the impugned rule was not only arbitrary but also posed a significant threat to the principles of inclusivity and equal opportunity. The Court further elucidated that the prescription of a 20-year experience benchmark lacked empirical substantiation, and there was no compelling evidence to suggest that such an extensive tenure was indispensable for discharging duties as an SCDRC member.</p>

    <p>By rendering this landmark verdict, the Supreme Court has not only struck a decisive blow to an unjust provision but has also set a precedent that reverberates with the ideals of meritocracy and fair representation. This momentous ruling reinvigorates the spirit of equal access and reinforces the notion that expertise is not solely determined by the passage of time but also by the acumen and dedication an individual brings to the table. It stands as a testament to the judiciary's commitment to safeguarding the principles of justice and inclusiveness.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body> </html>
